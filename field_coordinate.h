     * If the field is viewed where the home side is in the west and the
     * away side is in the east, then the x asix runs north to south. The
     * y axis runs west to east. A negative x value indicates a position
     * in the northern half of the field while a positive x value indicates
     * a position in the southern half of the field. A negative y value

     * of zero for both x and y indicate that the object is in the middle of
     * the field.

     * As an example, if we take an actual full sized 100 meter field, then
     * the middle of the goal line on the home side of the field would be at
     * the coordinates (0, -50). The middle of the away goal line would be
     * (0, 50). The middle line which separates the two sides of a field which 
     * is 60 meters wide runs from the points (-30, 0) to (30, 0).
